# Wave

Namespace with functions for spawning waves of mobs.

An example wave is provided in the following functions:
    wave:wave_example
    wave:wave_example_loop
    wave:wave_example_event
The example wave serves as a useful template. Loops and events are NOT
necessary for a wave; they are used in the example wave simply to
showcase how they could be done.
